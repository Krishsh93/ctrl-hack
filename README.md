# AI Healthcare Diagnosis and Management System

## Overview
The **Healthcare Diagnosis System** is an advanced AI-powered platform designed to assist with healthcare-related queries. Built using **Flask**, **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **Ollama**, this system provides:
- **Conversational AI** for general medical queries
- **Document-based Question Answering (RAG)** for uploaded PDFs
- **Speech-based interactions** for accessibility

## Features

### ðŸ”¹ Conversational AI for Medical Queries
- Users can interact with a **text-based chatbot** to ask medical-related questions.
- The chatbot maintains chat history for contextual responses.

### ðŸ”¹ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Document-Based QA
- Users can upload **PDF files** containing medical literature or reports.
- The chatbot extracts relevant information and answers specific queries based on the content.

### ðŸ”¹ FAISS-Based Vector Store
- Utilizes **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** for efficient medical data retrieval.
- Ensures **fast and accurate** information retrieval.

### ðŸ”¹ Ollama-Powered Medical AI Model
- Uses **Ollama's MedLLaMA2**, a specialized **LLM for medical applications**.
- Provides fact-based responses while avoiding speculative medical advice.

### ðŸ”¹ Voice-Based Interaction
- Supports **voice queries**, transcribing speech to text using **SpeechRecognition**.
- Enhances accessibility for users with limited typing ability.

### ðŸ”¹ Secure and Ethical AI
- **No medical diagnosis**: The chatbot retrieves medical knowledge but does not diagnose.
- **Privacy-focused**: Conversations and files are processed securely.
